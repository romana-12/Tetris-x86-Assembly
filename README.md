Tetris in x86 Assembly

This project is a Tetris clone developed in x86 Assembly Language as part of the COAL (Computer Organization and Assembly Language) course. The goal was to understand low-level programming concepts by implementing a classic game using assembly code and interfacing directly with hardware for graphics and input.

Features

    Real-mode graphics using BIOS interrupts

    Keyboard input handling

    Block movement and rotation

    Basic line-clearing logic

    Manual delay loops for timing

Requirements

    DOS emulator (e.g., DOSBox)

    NASM assembler

    16-bit compatible environment

Notes

This game was developed purely for educational purposes as a semester project. It provides a practical introduction to low-level memory management, I/O, and procedural graphics in real-mode x86 assembly.
